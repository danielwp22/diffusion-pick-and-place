# Diffusion Pick-and-Place (6-DoF Robotic Manipulation)

This project implements a **diffusion-based policy** using a **U-Net architecture** to perform **6-DoF pick-and-place manipulation** within the [Ravens](https://github.com/google-research/ravens) framework.  
By conditioning a diffusion model on visual observations and goal specifications, the system learns to generate continuous pick-and-place trajectories that achieve robust manipulation performance.

## ðŸš€ Overview

This work builds upon the **Ravens** benchmark by **Google Research**, extending it with a **diffusion-based policy network** trained for end-to-end robotic manipulation.

Key modifications:
- Added a **U-Net diffusion model** for action generation.
- Integrated a **custom DiffusionAgent** class for inference and training.
- Extended the **`utils.py`** file to support sampling and denoising processes.
- Demonstrated successful **6-DoF pick-and-place** with stable convergence.

## ðŸ§© Method

1. **Training Data:**  
   Collected expert trajectories from Ravensâ€™ pick-and-place environment.

2. **Model Architecture:**  
   - Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM)  
   - U-Net backbone with time-step conditioning  
   - Predicts 6-DoF end-effector poses for grasp and place actions

3. **Training Objective:**  
   \[
   \mathcal{L} = \mathbb{E}_{x_0, \epsilon, t} \big[ \| \epsilon - \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t) \|^2 \big]
   \]
   minimizing reconstruction error between true and predicted noise.

4. **Inference:**  
   At inference, the model iteratively denoises Gaussian samples into precise pick-and-place actions.

## ðŸ¦¾ Results

The diffusion policy was successfully able to:
- Generate smooth and physically feasible pick-and-place trajectories  
- Generalize across varying object poses  
- Achieve high success rates without explicit motion planning
